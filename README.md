# password-generator-homework
This homework has definitley been a challenge, it was really hard to make sense of it all.
I got help from my tutor, peers, and TAs. My peers were really nice and helpful but everyone had there own way of coding 
and what worked for them didn't always work for me. 
I'm definitely going to review notes, slides, and zoom class recording, untill I get this right on the money because I don't 
want to fall behine.
